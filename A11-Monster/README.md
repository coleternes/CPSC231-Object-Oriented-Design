# Monster

This program employs inheritance and polymorphism. The Monster class is the parent class to the Undead and Animal classes. The Undead class is the parent class to the Zombie and Vampire classes. The Animal class is the parent class to the Werewolf class. The MonsterDrive class creates an ArrayList of monsters, shuffles the list, then prints out all of the monsters with correct information.

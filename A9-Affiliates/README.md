# Affiliates

This program uses inheritance and polymorphism to construct a database for Chapman affiliates. The affiliate types are Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Full Professor, Graduate Student, Undergraduate Student, Full Time Staff, and Part Time Staff. The professor types have a parent class called AbstractFaculty; the student types have a parent class called AbstractStudents; and the staff types have a parent class called AbstractStaff. All of these abstract classes have a parent class called AbstractAffiliates. Two interfaces, called printable and comparable, interact with these classes as well. The driver class allows the user to create a record of an affiliate, print the information of an affiliate, print out all affiliates in senority order, and delete a record.

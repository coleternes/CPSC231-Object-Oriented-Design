# War Game

This program simulates the card game War. It can be simulated for as many times as the user wants it to. It uses the Card class to create a deck of cards for the Deck class. Then two players are created from the Player class. All of these objects then interact in the Game class so that it can play War. The Simulation class comes into play by repeating the Game class for however many times needed. Then the program calculates and outputs statistics for the user based on the games that were played.
